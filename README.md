# Abstract_class_Shape
Program contains the abstract class Shape, main class and four derived classes(Rectangle, Circle, Triangle and Square(also extends Rectangle class)). 
Program ask the user to choose a shape type and its parameters, then calculate and display the area and perimeter of the selected shape.
The process will continue until the user chooses to exit the program.

# Shape class
The abstract class. Its properties:
- name

# Rectangle class
Derived class. Super class of Square class. Its properties:
- width
- height

# Circle class
Derived class. Its properties:
- radius

# Triangle class
Derived class. Its properties:
- side1
- side2
- side3

# Square class
Derived class of abstract class Shape and superclass Rectangle. Its properties:
- length

In order to calculate the area and perimeter of shapes we used methods getArea and getPerimeter which are extended from abstract class Shape.
